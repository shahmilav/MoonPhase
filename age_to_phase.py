"""This module contains a method that converts the moon age into a phase.

The phases are ['New Moon', 'Waxing Cresent', 'First Quarter',
                'Waxing Gibbous', 'Full Moon', 'Waning Gibbous',
                'Last Quarter', 'Waning Crescent']

Using the moon age, the method runs through a series of if-statements to
determine the moon phase.
